# Our-first-SCA-Project-
This is repository was created so that my group members and I could work on our first project together 
# 🌼 Group Blog Project

Welcome to our Blog Repository! This is a collaborative project by a group of students exploring web development. Our goal is to build a simple but beautifully designed blog where we can share thoughts, tutorials, and stories as we learn.

## 📝 What This Project Is

This project is a beginner-friendly blog website built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (and possibly a little bit of backend in the future!). It’s designed to:

- Help us learn and practice real-world development skills
- Serve as a writing space for our group
- Grow over time into a full-featured blog platform

## 💡 Why This Exists

We created this project to:

- Apply what we're learning in web development
- Learn how to collaborate using Git and GitHub
- Create something useful and visually appealing
- Practice contributing to open-source-style projects
